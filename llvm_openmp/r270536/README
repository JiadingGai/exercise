Also, setting up environmental variables might be necessary as
well:

export PATH=/Users/jiadinggai/dev/LLVM/llvm.git.build/bin:$PATH
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/dev/LLVM/llvm.git.build/lib:${DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}
export LIBRARY_PATH=${HOME}/dev/LLVM/llvm.git.build/lib:${LIBRARY_PATH}
export CPATH=${HOME}/dev/LLVM/llvm.git.build/projects/openmp/runtime/src/:${CPATH}
